            In a quest to enhance my problem-solving skills on LeetCode, I embarked on a coding adventure. Armed with JavaScript wizardry and the power of Google Sheet APIs, I crafted a system that would send me timely email notifications. This ingenious creation ensured that the problems I conquered on the platform would not fade into obscurity but be revisited regularly, helping me cement my coding prowess and achieve new heights in my programming journey. It was a digital assistant that kept me on track, turning a simple spreadsheet into a dynamic learning companion.
