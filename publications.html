            I have three years of work experience as a software developer at Siemens. One of the biggest challenges I faced as a fresher was understanding the extensive codebase of my project. I had never encountered such production-ready code before, but with the help of my team members and effective communication, I quickly grasped it. Additionally, I learned a lot about debugging skills, which helped me gain a better understanding of the product. As I contributed to the team, I realized that teamwork and collaboration play a key role in product development.

          <p class="experience-paragraph">
            I worked in an Agile team, and it significantly helped me understand Agile methodology in software engineering. I had opportunities to work on frontend technologies such as .NET, React and also contributed to the codebase related to C++.

        <p class="experience-paragraph">
          During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as a web developer, building a portfolio website for one of the students at IU. I gained experience in gathering client requirements, adapting to the client's needs, and prioritizing technical development based on the client's requirements. There were few instances where I need to negotiate with client such as User Interface adjustments. This experience allowed me to explain technical terms in layman's language, helping the client understand the website's flow. Working on this project provided valuable insights into the client's perspective, which will be valuable lessons going forward as I work on other projects.

        The best way to test one's knowledge is to teach it to someone and I had that oppurtunity to work as associate instructor for the subject "Security for networked systems". I created comprehensive documentation for laboratory sessions and assisted in setting up Linux environments to improve student learning. I actively supported over 150 students by addressing their questions through various communication channels and held bi-weekly practical lab sessions for a class of 70+ students. Additionally, I oversaw examinations within the course.
